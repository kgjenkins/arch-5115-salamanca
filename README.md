## Some GIS Concepts

**GIS** stands for Geographic Information System (or Science)

"GIS data" refers to data with a spatial component -- it can be mapped!

**QGIS** (<https://qgis.org/>) is one of several popular GIS programs for mapping and spatial analysis.  It is free, open-source desktop software that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  QGIS is created by developers around the world, supported by municipal and national governments, corporations, user groups, and individual users.  Discussions about new features, bug fixes, and future directions happen on [e-mail lists](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/mailinglists.html) and the [project's GitHub organization](https://github.com/qgis).

Questions about how to use QGIS are typically asked and answered on [GIS StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/).  If you google for QGIS questions, there is a good chance you'll end up finding the answer already there, so always be sure to search before asking a new question.

**Vector** = points, lines, polygons
Common file formats are GeoPackage (.gpkg) and Shapefile (.shp, .dbf, .prj, etc.)

**Raster** = pixels (images, but also data)
Common file format is GeoTIFF (.tif)

Vector data does not usually contain any information about how to style the display of the data.

Styles are added in a map project.  The same data could be styled in different ways in different maps, or even in the same map!

The QGIS project file .qgz contains your styles and pointers to the data, but does not include the data itself.  I recommend keeping everything within a containing folder (there can be subfolders) that you can zip up or save to a device or the cloud.  Something like this:

* myproject/
  * data/
    * boundaries/
      * counties.gpkg
      * states.gpkg
    * buildings.gpkg
    * streets.shp
  * notes-about-sources.txt
  * mymap.qgz

**CRS** = Coordinate Reference System

Ideally, CRS details are quietly handled behind the scenes, so we barely even need to think about it.

But in the real world, you'll eventually run into CRS puzzles and problems, and CRS becomes even more important when doing distance- or area-based analysis.  Here are some of the CRS you might see in western NY:

* EPSG:4326 = WGS 84 -- "common longitude/latitude"
* EPSG:4269 = NAD 83 -- longitude/latitude, similar to WGS 84, but based on a model of the Earth only defined for North America
* EPSG:3857 = WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator -- also called "Web Mercator", uses false "meters" (only true at equator)
* EPSG:2262 = NAD83 / New York West (ftUS) -- one of many "state plane" coordinate systems
* EPSG:32617 = WGS 84 / UTM zone 17N (meters)
